#### How It Works

Toggle Category: When a user clicks on a category button, the toggle function is called, storing the clicked category's id in the state variable itemClicked.
Display Widgets: The application maps through the categories and checks if itemClicked matches the id of the category. If it does, the corresponding widgets are displayed.

<!-- ## Example

Here's a simple example of how the main logic works:

const toggle = (id) => {
setItemClicked(id);
};

{categories.map((category) => (
<>
<button
onClick={() => toggle(category.id)}
className="gap-2 mr-2 abs inline-block text-sm bg-slate-50 px-3 py-2 rounded-md"
key={category.id} >
{category.name.split(" ")[0]}
</button>
</>
))}

{categories.map((category) => (
<>
{itemClicked === category.id && (

<div>
{category.widgets.map((widget) => (
<div key={widget.id}>{widget.name}</div>
))}
</div>
)}
</>
))} -->
